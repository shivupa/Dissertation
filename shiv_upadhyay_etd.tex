%The document begins by specifying the first 'chapter' with the command '\chapter{}
\chapter{Introduction}%             
We begin by saying that we do not really have much to say, but for the sake of clarity we divide our topic in chapters.

The topic treated here, given its complexity, merits an additional subdivision.

This is well-known topic, and we shall discuss it no more.
\section{Testing the template}
I am trying to show how LaTeX works.
But I don't want to start a new paragraph \\ yet.
\cite{DUMMY:1}


\chapter{Second chapter}
The topics treated in this chapter can be somewhat obscure. For humanitarian considerations, the chapter will be subdivided.
