\section{Conclusions}
In this work, we exhaustively explore the binding of a postron to \ce{Be}.
We also compare our results to a collection of results from the literature and analyze the possible sources of error in both cases.
Through this analysis, we establish a binding energy for \ce{Be} of 91$\pm$4 meV.
This is in excellent agreement with the previous theoretical best estimate.
This also validates our protocol for obtaining reference positron affinities.
Extensive applications of this method to Be clusters and molecules is underway.
