\section{Conclusions}
In this work, we exhaustively explore the binding of a positron to \ce{Be}.
We also compare our results to those from the literature.
Our calculations with the most sophisticated trial wave functions give a positron binding energy for \ce{Be} of 91$\pm$4 meV.
This is in excellent agreement with the previous theoretical best estimate.
Applications of the \gls{dmc} method to Be clusters and molecules is underway.
