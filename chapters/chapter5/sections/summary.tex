\section{Summary}
The diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) method is used to calculate the \gls{pa} of \ce{Be}.
The effect of \ce{e-}-\ce{e+} correlation on the nodal surface is explored.
Results from the literature are analyzed with respect to reference values for \ce{Be}/\ce{e+}.
The best estimate of the \gls{pa} is in excellent agreement with the best estimate from literature.
