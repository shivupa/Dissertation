\section{Concluding Remarks}
In this paper, we propose Q-GPU, a framework tailored with GPU optimizations to effectively improve the quantum circuit simulation performance for quantum circuits with a large number of qubits. The Q-GPU is able to deliver scalable simulation performance based on the four internal end-to-end optimizations, including i) proactive state amplitudes transfer, ii) zero state amplitudes pruning, iii) delayed qubit involvement, and iv) lossless non-zero state compression. Experimental results across eight representative quantum circuits indicate that Q-GPU achieves 2.53$\times$ average execution time reduction on a single GPU. It also outperforms the most recent OpenMP CPU implementation and other publicly available quantum simulators.
