The author's contribution to the work included running the EOM calculations, generating the trial wavefunctions and running the VMC/DMC with the exception of the CIPSI trial wavefunctions and the coresponding QMC calculations. Additionally the author's contribution included the generation of figures and writing the manuscript.
% Should the following go in the appendix?
The Supplementary Material document includes the total energies and error bars for the quantum Monte Carlo calculations, the total energies for the DFT calculations, and details of the convergence of the DFT total energies with respect to the $k$-point grid and kinetic energy cutoff of the plane wave basis, and a comparison of the density difference of DMC-PBE and DMC-HSE.
