\section{Conclusions}
Calculations of the binding energy of a hydrogen atom on a graphene sheet were carried out using various DFT methods and with DMC.
The DMC calculations provide a benchmark value of the binding energy.

Our best estimate of the binding energy from DMC calculations is -691 $\pm$ 19 meV.
The PBE result obtained with a plane-wave basis set gives a binding energy about 20\% larger in magnitude than the DMC result.
The global hybrid functional, PBE0, gives a binding energy close to that of PBE.
In comparison, HSE, a range-separated hybrid functional, gives a smaller binding energy of -743 meV, after a correction applied for the basis set incompleteness error, and is much closer to the value from DMC calculations.
Interestingly, there are significant differences in the DMC and PBE charge densities of both graphene and H/graphene.
