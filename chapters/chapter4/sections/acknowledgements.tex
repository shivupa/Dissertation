An award of computer time was provided by the Innovative and Novel Computational Impact on Theory and Experiment (INCITE) program.
The DMC and plane wave DFT calculations used resources of the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility, which is a DOE Office of Science User Facility supported under contract DE-AC02-06CH11357. The DFT calculation using Gaussian orbitals were carried out on computing resources in the University of Pittsburgh's Center for Research Computing.
