\chapter{Introduction}

Chemistry involves the study of molecules and materials constructed from nuclei and electrons.
The theoretical description of a chemical system requires a consideration of the size of the system and of the target properties.
An ideal computational chemistry theoretical model would reproduce experimental observables in a computationally tractable amount of time.
In the following sections, Nonvalence anions and the related nonvalence positronic bound states are introduced along with the target properties of interest followed by a discussion of the computational chemistry methods used to describe these systems.
