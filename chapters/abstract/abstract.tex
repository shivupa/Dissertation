Certain atoms, molecules, and clusters can bind an excess electron or positron in a diffuse orbital.
Given the weak binding energy of these states, usually on the order of tens to hundreds of millielectron volts, the computed bindng energies are sensitive to the correlations between fermions in the system.
In order to quantitatively describe these systems, one must use computational methods that capture these correlation effects. 
In this work, we describe several nonvalence anions and diffuse positron bound states, and in the process we gain insight into the nature of correlation.
We use the insight gained to develop a strategy for treating these types of systems that is accurate, compact, and relatively computationally inexpensive.
The ideas developed here can also scale favorably to larger systems.
